Morio presets are used to keep our code. In other words, they are values 
set in a central location which are re-used in various parts of the code.

The full list of presets is kept in
[`config/presets.mjs`](https://github.com/certeu/morio/blob/develop/config/presets.mjs)
in [our monorepo](https://github.com/certeu/morio) and many of them should not
be changed - nor is there a reason to change them.

However, others can be changed, and this page lists those along with
instructions on how to change them.
