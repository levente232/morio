Morio releases are provided through different channels that each serve their
specific purpose. You should use the `production` channel unless you have
specific reasons not to.

**<big>📦 Production</big>**

The `production` channel provides stable releases that have been tested and
gone through an incubation period in the `canary` channel.  

This is the default channel. 
Use this channel unless you have specific reasons not to.

**<big>🐣 Canary</big>**

The `canary` channel provides early access to releases.
When no issues come up during a `canary` release's incubation period,
it is promoted to `production`.

The `canary` releases allows you to test an upcoming `production` release in
your specific environment, and limits the blast radius in case a problem is not
caught in `testing`. 
For this reason, we recommend to run the `canary` release on a _staging
instance_.


**<big>💣 Testing</big>**

The `testing` channel is not intended to be used for _real_ deployments.
Instead, this channel is used for our integration tests, as well as by
developers of and contributors to Morio to validate fixes or new features.

When a release in `testing` is validated, it graduates to `canary`.
