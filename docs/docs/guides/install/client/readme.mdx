title: Morio Client Installation Guide
sidebar_label: Client Install Guide
---

This guide covers the installation of the Morio client.
The process is a little different on each platform:

- [Installing the Morio client on Linux](#linux)
- [Installing the Morio client on MacOS](#macos)
- [Installing the Morio client on Windows](#windows)

However, for all of these the same principle applies:

- A preconfigured version of the client can be downloaded from your Morio
  instance
- A so-called _bare_ version of the client can be downloaded from the
  repositories provided by the Morio team

Unless there is a specific reason why you need the _bare_ client, you should use
the client packages made available by your Morio instance.

:::warning The bare client is not available yet
We do currently not (yet) publish a bare client, but it's on our todo list
:::

Once installed, refer to [the client configuration
guide](/docs/guides/settings/client/) for info on how to configure the client.

## Installing the Morio client on Linux {#linux}

### Pre-configured client from a Morio instance

To install the Morio client, run the command below from an account with `sudo`
rights, making sure to replace `example.morio.it` with the _FQDN_ of your Morio
collector:

```sh
curl -k https://example.morio.it/install/ | bash
```

### Bare Morio client

Download the bare client package suitable for your distribution:

- APT package: FIXME
- DEB package: FIXME 

Install the package.
