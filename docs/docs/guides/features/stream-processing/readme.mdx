title: Stream Processing Guides
---

Stream processing in Morio can be handled in two different ways:

- [Tap service](/docs/guides/features/stream-processing/tap/): Leverage Morio's _tap
  service_ to create stream processors in a low-code way
- [Kafka](/docs/guides/features/stream-processing/kafka/): Talk natively to the Kafka API
  utilising the stream processing framework of your choice

Click on any of the links above to learn more. If you are not certain which is
best for your use case, we recommend you start with [tap-based stream
processing](/docs/guides/settings/stream/tap/).
