title: Morio Identity and Access Management (IAM) Guide
sidebar_label: IAM Guide
---

This _IAM_ guide for Morio provides an overview of how authentication and
authorisation is handled in Morio.   
If you are wondering _who can do what? And how is that decided?_, this guide
should provide answers.

When discussing _IAM_ in Morio, we always need to start by making it clear
which _wire protocol_ we are talking about. You see, there are two different
ways to communicate with a Morio instance:

- [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html): This is the protocol to talk
  to a Morio broker
- [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP): This is the ubiquitous web
  protocol used to talk to the various Morio APIs and the web interface.

Each of the sections in this guide will be split up by wire protocol because
the technical implementation of those protocols is so vastly different that
they require their own approach to IAM.

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of establishing who a user is.

### Kafka Authentication

Kafka uses _mTLS_ for authentication. You need a certificate issued by Morio's
_CA_ to be able to connect. The value of the certificate's `CN` field (common
name) will be used as username.

You can generate your own (client) certificates to connect to a Kafka broker,
and you can choose the value of the CN freely.

However, the most common use case is to use the Morio client which is created
by your Morio instance and will come bundled with a client certificate. Below
is an example of the username (the value of the `CN` field) from a client
certificate that is auto-generated and bundled with the client installer
packages:

```
1729850558315.clients.8ad0d33a-f283-4cdb-80b9-7f1f5ce622ae.morio.internal
```

This is the user identity that is used to apply authorisation.

:::tip Good to know
The value of the certificate CN for the Morio client is constructed as:

```
[timestamp].clients.[cluster-uuid].morio.internal
```

- Including the timestamp ensures every client version has its own `CN` value.
- Including the cluster UUID ensures that clients certificates are linked to the
  Morio collector that generated them.
- Only accepting certificates from Morio's CA prevents users from generating a
  client certificate from a different CA with a `CN` value designed to bypass
  authorisation controls.
:::

### HTTP Authentication

For HTTP connections to Morio, all authentication is handled by the _API_.
It provides a modular way to configure various authentication backends through
the use of [identity providers](/docs/guides/settings/idps/).

:::tip mTLS is available behind a feature flag

As an extra layer of protection, you can enable the `ENFORCE_HTTP_MTLS` feature
flag, to enforce mTLS on all HTTP endpoints.  This will apply **in addition** to
the authentication described below.

Refer to [the reference documentation of the `ENFORCE_HTTP_MTLS` feature
flag](/docs/reference/flags#enforce_http_mtls) for more details.
:::


A user's identity is established by combining the username used by the
identity provider with the ID of the identity provider. Below is 
an example:

```
ad.aswartz
```

This is the user identity that is used to apply authorisation.


:::tip Good to know
The user identity for HTTP access in Morio is constructed as:

```
[Identity Provider ID].[Identity Provider Username]
```

The internal identity providers have a fixed ID. For example `mrt`, `local`, or
`apikey`. Other identity providers, like `ldap` or `oidc` have an ID assigned
when configuring that identity provider.

If we assume a scenario where a identity provider of type `ldap` is configured
with ID `ad`, then a user logging in as `aswartz` would be know to morio as
`ad.aswartz`.
:::

## Authorisation

Authorisation is the process of establishing what a user can (or cannot) do.

### Kafka Authorisation

When connecting over the Kafka protocol, authorisation is governed by the
access control list (ACL) that is configured on the broker.

[The RedPanda ACL
documentation](https://docs.redpanda.com/current/manage/security/authorization/acl/)
is the authoritative reference on the finer details of ACLs inside a broker
node.

Below is an example if (a subset of) the default ACL configured by Morio:

```
PRINCIPAL                                                           HOST  RESOURCE-TYPE  RESOURCE-NAME  RESOURCE-PATTERN-TYPE  OPERATION  PERMISSION
User:*.clients.3ffcd9cd-a8a9-42ce-a29b-b9e0d0102f6f.morio.internal  *     TOPIC          logs           LITERAL                WRITE      ALLOW
User:*.clients.3ffcd9cd-a8a9-42ce-a29b-b9e0d0102f6f.morio.internal  *     TOPIC          logs           LITERAL                CREATE     ALLOW
User:*.clients.3ffcd9cd-a8a9-42ce-a29b-b9e0d0102f6f.morio.internal  *     TOPIC          logs           LITERAL                DESCRIBE   ALLOW
```

For the purpose of this guide, it sufficient to understand the various fields
used in the ACL:

**PRINCIPAL**

This is made up of `type:value` where `type` is **always** `User` so in
practice this always is `User:id`, and it describes the user identity.

:::tip
Keep in mind that customises the broker configuration to extract the value of
the `CN` as user identification. This is different from the examples you see in
the RedPanda documentation where the entire certificate string is used.

So in the RedPanda documentation, you might see something like
this as the user id:

```
C=UK,ST=London,L=London,O=Redpanda,OU=engineering,CN=__schema_registry
```

In morio, the same user would be known as:
```
__schema_registry
```

:::

**HOST**

This allows one to limit the host(s) from which clients are allowed to connect.
We typically set this to `*` to not impose any restrictions.

**RESOURCE-TYPE**

This describes the type of resource. It can be one of `TOPIC`, `CLUSTER`,
`GROUP`, or `TRANSACTIONAL_ID`. 

You can almost certainly ignore all but `TOPIC` since that is the resource type
that controls who can read and write data to the topics.

**RESOURCE-NAME**

This is the name of the resource, so its exact meaning depends on the resource
type.  For example, when the resource type of `TOPIC`, this will be the topic
name.

**RESOURCE-PATTERN-TYPE**

This controls how the resource name will be matched. Possible options are:

- `match`: Check a wildcard match. Using `bana*` will match `banana`.
- `prefix`: Check a prefix. Using `bana` will match `banana`.
- `literal`: Match only exactly. Only `banana` will match `banana`.
- `any`: Combines `prefix` and `literal`.

:::tip
Using `literal` is the safest option. 
So it is also what Morio uses in the auto-generated ACL rules.
:::

**OPERATION**

The operation describes the action taken on a resource. It is one of 
`READ`, `WRITE`, `CREATE`, `DELETE`, `ALTER`, `DESCRIBE`, `DESCRIBE_CONFIGS`,
`ALTER_CONFIGS`, or `ALL`.

:::tip
To produce to a topic, or to write data to the broker if you will, you need the
`WRITE`, and `DESCRIBE` rights.  If the topic needs to be created if it does
not already exist, you also need the `CREATE` operation.
:::

**PERMISSION**

Permission can be one of `ALLOW` or `DENY`. Given that `DENY` is the default,
you typically will never use it unless you need to deny something specific
before hitting a broader allow rule in your ACL.

#### Managing Kafka authorisation

You can manage the broker ACL through RedPanda console.

In the Morio web interface, click **Status** and then **RedPanda Console**.
In the console, click **Security** in the sidebar, then the **ACLs** tab.
You can also get there directly by navigating to `/console/security/acls`.

Alternatively, you can manage the ACL directly on the broker via the command line.
For example, to see the current ACL, run this command on a _broker node_:

```sh
docker exec -it morio-broker rpk security acl list
```

To learn how to manage the ACL from the command line, run: 

```sh
docker exec -it morio-broker rpk security acl -h
```

:::warning Sadly no API
There is currently no API to manage the broker ACL

### HTTP Authorisation

Authorisation for HTTP is divided in two different approaches:

- _RBAC_: Role Based Access Control governs who can manage Morio
- _ABAC_: Attribute Based Access Control governs who can use Morio

The reasons for this split will become clear when we look at both.

#### RBAC

Role-based access control governs which roles can do what when it comes to
managing Morio. For example, creating users, or updating the Morio settings,
or restarting a container. These are all things where RBAC is used.

There is the base `user` role, and then there are various roles that elevate
permissions to allow users to make changes to the system.

Another way to look at this is that RBAC governs everything where the Morio
developers can unilaterally decide which role can do what. Like, updating the
settings of a Morio instance is not something that can ever be done by the
`user` role. That is decided by the developers, and you cannot change that.
Our only job is to decide which user gets what role.

To do that, we need to know what role can do what.
Note that roles are cumulative, so every higher role can do everything the
roles below it can. The _lowest_ role is `user`, the highest role is `root`.
The table below includes all roles, from lowest to highest:

| Role | Description | Audience |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- |
| `user` | Minimal role needed to be able to sign in to Morio | All users in your organisation |
| `manager` | Allows the creation of local Morio user accounts | Team leaders, IT support staff |
| `operator` | Allows changing the Morio settings | IT Operations staff |
| `engineer` | Allows decryption of Morio data | IT Engineers, or staff doing Morio troubleshooting |
| `root` | Allows exporting key data | Break-glass access |

:::tip Use gitops rather than the operator role

We recommend using _gitops_ to manage your Morio deployments.
This not only negates the need to have a bunch of people who have the ability
to update the Morio settings, it also creates an audit trail and keeps your
settings under version control.

Refer to [the gitops guide](/docs/guides/integrations/gitops/) for more details.
:::

##### Assigning roles to identities

Now that we know which roles are available, there's still the matter of how to
assign a given role to a specific user.

The exact process differs based on the identity provider in use:

- `mrt`: You cannot assign any roles with this provider. There is only one user
  (`root`) and its role is always `root`.
- `local`: When you create a new account, you decide on its (maximum) role. You
  can never create an account with a role higher than your own.
- `local`: When you create a new API key, you decide on its (maximum) role. You
  can never create an API key with a role higher than your own.
- `ldap`: The `ldap` identity provider allows configuring the assignment of
  Morio roles based on any field of the LDAP user object. Refer to the
  [Identity Providers Guide](/docs/guides/settings/idps/#ldap) for details.
- `oidc`: The `oidc` (OpenID Connect) identity provider allows configuring the
  assignment of Morio roles based on any property provided by the OpenID
  provider. Refer to the [Identity Providers
  Guide](/docs/guides/settings/idps/#openid-connect) for details.


#### ABAC

Attribute-based access control governs which users can do what when it comes to
using Morio. Or more accurately, accessing the data inside Morio.

When you start putting data in a Morio system, you may want to grant some users
access to this data, and other users access to that data.  None of these users
should have any elevated privileges to change the Morio system, so we don't
want to give them a role that is higher than `user`. However, we still want
control over who can do (or rather see) what. This is where ABAC comes in.

Another way to look at this is that when you start putting your data in Morio,
the Morio developers cannot make a decision on your behalf about which user can
see what. So **ABAC is something you have to configure yourself**.
