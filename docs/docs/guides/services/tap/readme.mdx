The **Morio Tap Service** (tap) provides stream processing capabilities in
Morio.

The tap service is built around the idea of _bring your own business logic
(BYOBL)_.
Stream processing is a powerful feature, but writing stream processing code is
a non-trivial matter.  The tap service takes care of all of the low-level
stream processing code for you, allowing you to focus on your business logic
instead.

You write the logic of what to do with the data, and the tap service allows you to _tap into_ the stream without having to worry about how to do that. And now you know why it is named like that.

To learn more about stream processing in Morio, including how to create your
own stream processor on top of the tap service, refer to [the stream processing
guide](/docs/guides/features/stream-processing/).
