The **Morio Debian Repository Builder Service** (drbuilder) is an on-demand 
service that builds Morio repository packages in `.deb` format, the package 
format used by Debian-based Linux distributions.

As an on-demand service, it is not running all the time, instead it is started
by [the core service](/docs/guides/services/core) whenever a `.deb` repository
package needs to be built.

## DRBuilder service responsibilities

The drbuilder service is present on every Morio [broker node
](/docs/reference/terminology/broker-node/), and handles the following
responsibilities:

### Building .deb Morio repository packages

The drbuilder service has one job and one job only: building repository packages
for Debian-based Linux distributions.

These repository packages go by the name `morio-repo` and they exist to
facilitate the installation of the Morio client on Debian based Linux systems.
Specifically, they setup the APT repository that is hosted by the Morio
collector, and add its key as a trusted key to apt. This allows to install the
Morio client and get all updates from this repository hosted on the collector.

### Maintaining an APT software repository

Upon building packages, this service will update the APT repository hosted by
the Morio collector at `/repos/apt`.

:::tip Using this repository

You can add this repository to your system:

```
deb https://[your-collector]/repos/apt/ bookworm main
```

Or go to `/install` on your collector for an automated install script that will
set up this repository.

:::note
Under the hood, this services uses the `itsmorio/dbuilder` container image, the
same image used by [the DBuilder Service](/docs/guides/services/dbuilder).
