The **Morio Cache Service** (cache) provides data caching in Morio.<br /> 
Under the hood, this service is backed by [ValKey](https://valkey.io/) -- the
open source [Redis](https://redis.io/) fork.

The cache is an in-memory data store, and is not persisted to disk.
In other words, all cache data is ephemeral and will be lost when Morio restarts.

The cache service was added to support the stream processing capabilities
provided by the _tap service_.

It allows caching of recent data flowing through Morio, which in turn powers
the Morio dashboarding features that are available through the _UI service_.

## Access to the cache service

The cache service is not exposed as an external service. In other
words, Morio does not provide a Redis-like service that you can utilise for
non-Morio use-cases, like our (persistent) _KV store_.

Instead, the cache service is available internally to the _tap service_.
Externally, you can read cache keys through the _API service_, but writing to
the cache is not supported outside the tap service.
