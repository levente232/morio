The **Morio Debian Builder Service** (dbuilder) is an on-demand service that builds
Morio client packages in `.deb` format, the package format used by
Debian-based Linux distributions.

As an on-demand service, it is not running all the time, instead it is started
by [the core service](/docs/guides/services/core) whenever a `.deb` client
package needs to be built.

## DBuilder service responsibilities

The dbuilder service is present on every Morio [broker node
](/docs/reference/terminology/broker-node/), and handles the following
responsibilities:

### Building .deb Morio client packages

The dbuilder service has one job and one job only: building client packages
for Debian-based Linux distributions.

### Maintaining an APT software repository

Upon building packages, this service will update the APT repository hosted by
the Morio collector at `/repos/apt`.

:::tip Using this repository

You can add this repository to your system:

```
deb https://[your-collector]/repos/apt/ bookworm main
```

Or go to `/install` on your collector for an automated install script that will
set up this repository.

:::note
Under the hood, this services uses the `itsmorio/dbuilder` container image, the
same image used by [the DBuilder Service](/docs/guides/services/dbuilder).
