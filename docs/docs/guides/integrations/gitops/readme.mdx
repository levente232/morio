We recommend using _gitops_ to manage your Morio deployments.
By which we mean: Rather than configure your Morio instances via the UI or
through the API, keep your settings under version control with git, and then let
Morio load them from there.

That's right, you do not even need to write a CI/CD pipeline to update the
settings. All you need to do is let Morio know it should update its settings
from git, and it will do so.

## Repository layout

### Base settings and overlays

Morio expects a base settings file, and optionally one or more overlays.  Where
you place them in your repository is your own choice. The base file is
configured with the exact path to it, and the (optional) overlays are
configured with a glob pattern. So you have flexibility.

A common way to structure such a repository is as such:

```
- settings
  - production
     - base.yaml
  - staging
     - base.yaml
  - testing
     - base.yaml
- overlays
  - client-modules.yaml
  - idp-sso.yaml
  - idp-ldap.yaml
  - ui-login-settings.yaml
  - vault-integration.yaml
```

The idea here is that different Morio deployments have their own base file, yet
the overlays can be used by each of them.

You know best what works for your use case, it's just an example.

### Client modules

The Morio client needs to be configured with modules to tell it what data to
collect. You _can_ do that manually on each system. Or you could keep those
files in git and then distribute them with Ansible or some other automation
tool. But you don't have to.

Morio can load client modules from git, and will bundle them with the client
package when building client packages.  This way, when you install the client,
it will come with all your modules, you just need to enable the ones you want.

The structure here is not something you can choose freely. It needs to follow
the structure of [the `morio-templates`
repository](https://github.com/certeu/morio-templates).

Specifically, it should look like this:

```
- modules
  - audit
    - module-templates.d
      - module1.yaml
      - module2.yaml
    - rule-templates.d
      - module1.rules
      - module2.rules
  - logs
    - input-templates.d
      - module1.yaml
      - module2.yaml
    - module-templates.d
      - module1.yaml
      - module2.yaml
  - metrics
    - module-templates.d
      - module1.yaml
      - module2.yaml
```

## GitOps workflow

Before we dive into how this all works and how we can configure it, let's look
at the high-level workflow of deploying and managing Morio through gitops.

### Initial setup

:::warning Perhaps not for your first time?
If this is your first Morio deployment, perhaps consider configuring Morio
manually, and then migrate your settings to a gitops workflow. Here's why:

- The UI can guide you through the setup process, which is a lot easier than
  writing a settings file from scratch.
- When you inevitably need to add _secrets_ to your settings, you have a
  chicken/egg situation where you do not want to store secrets in git, but
  until it is setup, Morio cannot encrypt them for you. Likewise when you 
  use the Vault/OpenBao integration, you cannot configure it fully until the
  Morio public key is known.

For these reasons, we advice against cold-starting a Morio deployment via
gitops if this is your first time setting up Morio.
:::

For the initial Morio setup, you should use [the `/preseed` endpoint of the
API](/docs/reference/apis/api#tag/settings/operation/preseed), and not [the
`/setup` endpoint](/docs/reference/apis/api#tag/settings/operation/setup).

The reason is that `/setup` expects valid settings, whereas `/preseed` only
expects the preseed settings and will then reach out to git to get the rest.

You can refer to [the `settings.preseed` reference
documentation](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/) for all details, but we'll
use an example below that is probably close to what you might want to use:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="a" label="From GitHub">
Replace the following in the example below:

- `https://github.com/certeu/repo`: The URL to your GitHub repository
- `USERNAME`: The username that the `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` belongs to. This
  needs to be a user that can clone the repository.
- `PAT`: The GitHub personal access token (pat)
- `settings/production/base.yaml`: The location of your base settings file in
  the repository
- `settings/overlays/*.yaml`: An optional glob pattern for any overlays you
  want to load from your repository.

```json title="Example preseed settings for GitHub"
{
  "git": {
    "config": {
      "url": "https://github.com/certeu/repo",
      "user": "USERNAME",
      "token": "PAT"
    },
    "templatehub": {
      "url": "https://github.com/certeu/morio-templates.git"
    }
  },
  "base": "git:settings/production/base.yaml@config",
  "overlays": "git:settings/overlays/*.yaml@config"
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="b" label="From GitLab">
Replace the following in the example below:

- `https://gitlab.com/certeu/repo`: The URL to your GitLab repository (self-hosted is OK too)
- `USERNAME`: The username does not matter for GitLab project tokens
- `PAT`: The GitLab Project Access Token (PAT)

```json title="Example preseed settings for GitLab"
{
  "git": {
    "config": {
      "url": "https://gitlab.com/certeu/repo",
      "user": "USERNAME",
      "token": "PAT"
    },
    "templatehub": {
      "url": "https://github.com/certeu/morio-templates.git"
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If we assume you save these settings in a file name `preseed.json` you can now
setup Morio with this curl command:

```sh
curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json"  \
 -d@preseed.json \
 https://example.morio.it/-/api/preseed 
```

### Updating Morio settings

To update Morio settings, you update the data in your git repository. Then when
you're happy, you hit [the `/reseed` endpoint of the
API](/docs/reference/apis/api#tag/settings/operation/reseed).

:::tip
This endpoint requires authentication, so you probably want to create an API
key for this.
:::

In your CI/CD pipeline, running the following curl command is sufficient:

```sh
curl -k -u "API_KEY_ID:API_KEY_SECRET" https://example.morio.it/-/api/reseed
```

where `API_KEY_ID` and `API_KEY_SECRET` should be replaced with real values.
