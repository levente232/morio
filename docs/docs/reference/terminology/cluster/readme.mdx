A _cluster_, in Morio, is made of all the nodes that work together to provide
the various Morio services.

:::info
In Morio, a single-node cluster is also a cluster because at any moment you can
add _flanking nodes_ to it. Given that every Morio deployment supports
clustering, they are all clusters.
