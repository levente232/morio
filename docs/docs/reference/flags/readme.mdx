title: Feature Flags
---

Feature flags -- or Flags for short -- allow you to enable or disable certain
features inside Morio.

Note that all flags are disabled by default, so you can only ever _enable_
flags, even if that flag disables something.

For example, to **disable** the UI service, you can **enable** the
`HEADLESS_MORIO` flag.

The full list of feature flags is included below.

## `DISABLE_IDP_APIKEY`

Enable this flag to disable [the `apikey` identity
provider](/docs/guides/settings/idps#apikey) thereby blocking authentication
via API Keys.

## `DISABLE_IDP_LDAP`

Enable this flag to disable [the `ldap` identity
provider](/docs/guides/settings/idps#ldap) thereby blocking authentication via
any LDAP backend.

## `DISABLE_IDP_LOCAL`

Enable this flag to disable [the `local` identity
provider](/docs/guides/settings/idps#local) thereby blocking authentication via
local Morio accounts.

## `DISABLE_IDP_MRT`

Enable this flag to disable [the `mrt` identity
provider](/docs/guides/settings/idps#mrt) thereby blocking authentication via
the _Morio Root Token_.

Note that if you enable this flag in your initial settings, you will have
effectively locked yourself out of your Morio deployment unless you have also
included an alternative identity provider.

As such, we recommend to not enable this flag until after you have made sure
you have an alternative identity provider that you know is functioning as
expected.

:::info You currently cannot rotate the root token

You cannot -- at this time -- rotate the Morio Root Token.  We plan to add
support for rotating the root token in the future, but for the time being it is
not supported.

So this flag can be used as a short-term solution in case your root token is
compromised.

## `DISABLE_IDP_OIDC`

Enable this flag to disable [the `oidc` identity
provider](/docs/guides/settings/idps#openid-connect) thereby blocking
authentication via any OpenID Connect backend.

## `DISABLE_SERVICE_UI`

Enable this flag to disable [the UI service](/docs/guides/services/ui) and run
Morio in headless mode where you can only use [the API](/docs/guides/apis/api)
to manage it.

:::warning FIXME 
This flag is not implemented yet, but  on our todo list.

## `ENFORCE_HTTP_MTLS`

Enable this feature flag to enforce _mTLS_ on all HTTP endpoints.

The purpose of this feature flag is to add an extra layer of defence so prevent
anyone from being able to establish an HTTP connection to your Morio instance.
This is useful when deploying Morio in hostile environments, such as on the
Internet.
 
The extra mTLS authentication comes in addition to Morio's standard HTTP
authentication, as described in [the IAM guide](/docs/guides/settings/iam/).
In other words, this is not a replacement for any other authentication, but
adds an extra authentication layer.

## `RESEED_ON_RELOAD`

Enable this flag to _reseed_ Morio when reloading.

This flag comes into play when you have have `preseed.git` settings that make
Morio clone a git repository locally. This gives you various ways to keep your
configuration under version control, as outlined in [the Preseeding 
Guide](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/).

By default, Morio will not re-clone the repository when you make a
configuration change, or when you restart Morio. Instead, it will only update
the git repository from the remote when you explicitly reseed Morio through
[the `reseed` API
endpoint](/docs/reference/apis/api/#tag/settings/operation/reseed), (or via the
UI which uses this endpoint under the hood).

When you enable this flag, Morio will reseed (thus update the local git content
from the remote) whenever you restart it, or update its configuration.

:::warning
Even with this flag enabled, Morio will not reseed the data when it restarts
in an unforeseen way, such as with a server reboot.
:::

:::info Understanding then this flag takes effect

When updating the Morio settings, there are three steps:

- Core receives the configuration update request
- Core will reseed if the `RESEED_ON_RELOAD` flag is set
- Core will apply the new configuration

This means that if you change this flag in an update to the settings, it will
not take effect until the next update.

In other words, the flag value of the **running configuration** is used, not 
the flag value of the **new settings**.
