title: Presets
---

Morio presets are pre-configured settings.

They can be changed, but whether that can be done on a running Morio instance
or only during the initial setup depends on the specific preset.

Refer to the documentation of the various presets below for more details.


## MORIO_DOCKER_SOCKET

The location of the Docker socket on the host
OS.

You typically would change this on a fresh Morio install, although technically
it can also be changed on a running Morio system.  To do so:

  - Update the `/etc/morio/moriod/moriod.env` file and set your custom
  location for the Docker socket
  - Run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` to reload the systemd unit files
  - Restart Morio by running: `sudo morio restart`


```txt title="MORIO_DOCKER_SOCKET default value:"
/var/run/docker.sock
```


## MORIO_CONFIG_ROOT

Location of the Morio configuration folder on the
host OS.

You can only change this on a fresh Morio install. To do so:

  - Update the `/etc/morio/moriod/moriod.env` file and set your custom
  location for the config root
  - Run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` to reload the systemd unit files
  - Restart Morio by running: `sudo morio restart`


```txt title="MORIO_CONFIG_ROOT default value:"
/etc/morio/moriod
```


## MORIO_DATA_ROOT

Location of the Morio data folder on the host OS.

You can only change this on a fresh Morio install. To do so:

  - Update the `/etc/morio/moriod/moriod.env` file and set your custom
  location for the data root
  - Run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` to reload the systemd unit files
  - Restart Morio by running: `sudo morio restart`


```txt title="MORIO_DATA_ROOT default value:"
/var/lib/morio/moriod
```


## MORIO_LOGS_ROOT

Location of the Morio logs folder on the host OS.

You would typically change this on a fresh Morio install, but it can also be
changed on a running Morio instance. To do so:

  - Update the `/etc/morio/moriod/moriod.env` file and set your custom
  location for the logs root
  - Run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` to reload the systemd unit files
  - Restart Morio by running: `sudo morio restart`


```txt title="MORIO_LOGS_ROOT default value:"
/var/log/morio/moriod
```


## MORIO_NETWORK_SUBNET

Subnet to use for the internal Morio Docker
network.

You may need to change this if you have clients that connect from a network
that shares the same subnet.  In this case, the client will not be able to
communicate since it will seem to be local when it is not.

In this case, and probably only in this case, you should change the subnet to
any other private network.

To change this, set `tokens.presets.MORIO_NETWORK_SUBNET` in your Morio
settings.

```txt title="MORIO_NETWORK_SUBNET default value:"
192.168.144.32/28
```


## MORIO_NETWORK_MTU

MTU to configure on the internal Morio Docker
network.

If you are considering changing the MTU, you probably know what you're doing.
In general, this can be useful to avoid fragmentation.

To change this, set `tokens.presets.MORIO_NETWORK_MTU` in your Morio
settings.

```txt title="MORIO_NETWORK_MTU default value:"
1500
```


## MORIO_DOCKER_LOG_DRIVER

The Docker log driver to use for created
containers.

Morio assumes that `systemd` is present, and so we use the `journald` log
driver for Docker. If you are running Morio on a system without `systemd`
you will need to change this.

You should change this on a fresh Morio install. To do so:

  - Update the `/etc/morio/moriod/moriod.env` file and set your custom
  log driver for Docker
  - Run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` to reload the systemd unit files
  - Restart Morio by running: `sudo morio restart`

:::warning FIXME
This is not yet implemented
:::


```txt title="MORIO_DOCKER_LOG_DRIVER default value:"
journald
```


## MORIO_DOCKER_ADD_HOST

Optional `host:ip` resolution to add to the
containers configuration.

This is typically used to facilitate the development or testing of Morio.
It is not the kind of setup that you want to run in production: use DNS instead.

To update this, set the `MORIO_DOCKER_ADD_HOST` environment variable when
launching the Morio core container.

```txt title="MORIO_DOCKER_ADD_HOST default value:"
false
```


## MORIO_API_JWT_EXPIRY

Maximum lifetime of a JSON Web Token generated
by Morio.

The notation here is the one used by [Go's time
package](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration).

To change this, set `tokens.presets.MORIO_API_JWT_EXPIRY` in your Morio
settings.

```txt title="MORIO_API_JWT_EXPIRY default value:"
12h
```


## MORIO_API_LOG_LEVEL

Log level of the API service.
One of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, or
`silent`.
