Role-based access control (RBAC) is an abstraction to configure user
permissions in computer systems.
Rather than assign rights to users directly, rights are assigned to roles.
Users are then in turn assigned to one or more roles.

For example, if user `tony` manages the support team and requires extra
privileges to do their job, rather than assign those rights directly to Tony,
with RBAC we will assign those rights to a `manager` role, and then assign that
`manager` role to Tony.
