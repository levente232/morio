Bring your own business logic (BYOBL) is used to refer to the low-code
stream processing capabilities provided by Morio's Tap service. 

This service abstracts all of the complexities of handling streaming data,
allowing you to write a simple method that only implements your business logic.
Everything else is transparently managed by Morio.
