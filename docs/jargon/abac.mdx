Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an abstraction to configure user
permissions in computer systems, not unlike role-based access control (_RBAC_).

The difference is in how permissions are mapped to users. With RBAC, each user
has one or more roles that govern their access level.

With ABAC, an attribute of the user's account info is used to assign
privileges.
A common example is to use group membership as a way to bestow privileges on
users.
