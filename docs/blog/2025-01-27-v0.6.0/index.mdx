We have released version 0.6.0 of Morio, a new minor release that bundles a
bunch of exciting improvements as well as new features.
Let's have a look at the most important changes.

## Announcing MorioHub

One thing we cannot know about Morio is how people will end up using it.
What data will be processed, or what business challenges are being
addressed. Essentially, when it comes to the data plane, we cannot know
for sure what things will look like, so what we want to offer is 
flexibility to deal with a variety of scenarios.

To some extent, we can foresee such flexibility and incorporate it in our
design. But at the end of the day, we need a way for people to be able to
_plug in_ their own logic or configuration in an easy way.

To that extent, we currently have 3 different ways you can add your own
logic or configuration to Morio:

- A **settings overlay** adds certain settings to your Morio setup
- A **client module** bundles configuration for the various client agents
- A **stream processor** implements business logic for our tap service

:::tip
Some of these are new since this release, so keep reading to learn more.
:::

To make all of these available -- as well as facilitate contributions from
the community -- we have started building out [MorioHub](/hub).

MorioHub is a centralised repository for these various plugins for Morio.
Specifically, it is [a dedicated git 
repository](https://github.com/certeu/moriohub) from which you can load
client modules, stream processors, or even some of Morio's settings.

To facilitate discoverability, we have also [integrated MorioHub in this
website](/hub), and we plan integration with the Morio UI in a future update.

## Stream processing & BYOBL

Since Morio uses Kafka -- nay, RedPanda -- as its streaming data backbone, you
could already do stream processing on Morio's data. But you had to roll your
own solution, which is non-trivial.

In this release, we are proud to introduce Morio's new [Tap
service](/docs/guides/services/tap) which allows you to _tap into the data
stream_ (hence the name) without having to handle any of the complicated stream
processing yourself.

In practical terms, this is a low-code solution that allows you to _bring your
own business logic_ (_BYOBL_).

In addition to offering the capabilities to deploy your own stream processor
with minimal knowledge required, we also [publish several stream processors
on MorioHub](/hub/processors/) that do a bunch of common tasks, such as caching
log data, or metrics, building out an inventory, and so on.

This feature relies on [the cache service](/docs/guides/services/cache/) as
well as the new inventory tables, but more on that later.

For more information, please refer to [the Tap stream processing
guide](/docs/guides/features/stream-processing/tap/).

## The new cache service facilitates dashboarding (wip)

In tandem with Morio's new stream processing capabilities, we have added [the
new cache service](/docs/guides/services/cache/).

This allows us to provide dashboarding in the Morio UI, giving real-time
insights into the data that is flowing through Morio.

:::tip
This is a work in progress, so expect more updates in subsequent Morio
releases.

## New inventory tables and API endpoints

Another feature set that is tied to the new stream processing capabilities are
the new database tables and API endpoints to build out a Morio inventory.

We have created a stream processor for this that you can enable to have Morio
build out an inventory over time.

This too is something we'll build upon in future updates.

## Improvements to the Morio client and its templates

We've also made important changes to the Morio client, and sweeping (and
breaking) changes to the way we handle client modules, or their templates if
you will.

Essentially, we have significantly reduced the amount of boilerplate, making it
easy to implement your own client modules for Morio.

We've also changed our client build to generate a statically linked executable,
making the client more portable on different (versions of) operating systems.

## And much more

There's a lot more that went into this release. Here are some more highlights:

### Support for raw LSCL input in connector config

The connector service now supports raw _LSCL_ for configuring your data
pipelines, thus allowing you to reuse any existing Logstash pipelines you may
have.

### Support for editing settings by hand through the UI

The UI now also allows you to hand edit the entire settings file, thus giving
you the full power of updating the settings through the API, through Morio's
UI.

### Changes to preseed settings, and reseeding support

We've made changes to how we handle preseeding, making it more powerful and versatile.
Refer to [the preseeding guide](/docs/guides/settings/preseed/) for all details.

We're also deprecating preseeding via GitHub or GitLab APIs and will only
support preseeding via git going forward.

### Add the `force_mrt` parameter to avoid lockout

We've added a `force_mrt` URL parameter to Morio's sign-in page to force the
inclusion of the Morio Root Token identity provider on the sign-in form.

Note that this does not bypass [the `DISABLE_IDP_MRT` feature 
flag](/docs/reference/flags/#disable_idp_mrt). Rather, it prevents you from 
locking yourself out of the UI if you neglect to add the MRT provider to the
sign in page.

### Images are now published for our 3 release channels

We have completed support for our 3 release channels:

- `stable`: Our best work
- `canary`: Preview releases of what we intend to release as `stable`
- `testing`: Bleeding edge releases for testing and development. Not stable.

All docker images are now tagged as follows (using `0.6` as an example
version):

- `v0.6`: The `0.6` release in the `stable` channel.
- `v0.6-canary`: The `0.6` release in the `canary` channel.
- `v0.6-testing`: The `0.6` release in the `testing` channel.
- `stable`: The most recent release in the `stable` channel.
- `canary`: The most recent release in the `canary` channel.
- `testing`: The most recent release in the `testing` channel.
- `latest`: The most recent release in the `stable` channel (this is an alias
  for `stable`, and what Docker uses if no specific tag is provided).

For software packages, each release channel has its own repository.

### Generic APT repositories

When we initially created our Debian software repositories, they were tied to
Debian Bookworm. We have since recreated these repositories, and now they
are not tied to a specific Debian version any more, or even to Debian itself for that matter.

It means that you can use them on a different Debian version, or even on Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu.

### The Morio client is now statically linked

We have changed the way we build the Morio client to produce a statically
linked binary. This makes the client more portable across different (versions
of) operating systems.

### Extended use of a systemd environment file for moriod

We have a new `moriod.env` file to pre-configure the Moriod service.
This allows you to change certain Moriod presets, much as you would do
by passing custom environment parameters to a container.

### Provide guidance for FQDN mismatch during setup

Morio will not validate a setup when the FQDN used to access Morio in the
browser is not included in the list of broken FQDNs. We've now added a helpful
message to help identify this issue.

### The `/up` API endpoint is now anonymous

This endpoint is provided for fast health checks on the API, and as such no
longer requires authentication.

### Speed up reloading and restarting of Morio

We've made changes to the various life cycle methods of the services in Morio
core, and in doing so have significantly reduced the time needed for Morio to
reconfigure itself or restart.
