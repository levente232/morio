We have released version 0.7.0 of Morio, a new minor release that replaces
the software underpinning Morio's _connector service_.

## Out with Logstash

We've been running Morio in production for a while now, and as we continue to
integrate more and more systems with it, the amount of data flowing through our
Morio instance increases.

We also forward logs collected by Morio to our SIEM solution, leveraging
Morio's connector service to do so.  What we noticed is that as the load
increases, the memory footprint of Logstash -- which underpinned the connector
service -- would balloon to the point where the system would start swapping
which would lead to a negative feedback loop where performance would plummet.

Now it's worth pointing out that we run this on a 4-core / 8GB memory box. We
are deliberately keeping it on a conservative amount of memory precisely
because we don't want to paper over any performance issues.

It wasn't a hard problem to diagnose, and it was also clear to point to the
root cause, which is Logstash and its thirst for memory.

## In with Vector

In our original plans, we reached for Logstash to underpin the connector
service mostly because we had experience with it, because it allows for many
different outputs and inputs, and, since we're using the Beats agents, 
it seemed like a good fit.

But it was not a passionate choice for Logstash. It runs on the JVM -- which
we don't love -- its _LSCL_ configuration language is undocumented, and it's
hard to troubleshoot.

We had been keeping an eye on [Vector](https://vector.dev/) for a while,
but without a good reason to make the change, it felt like we always had
more urgent matters to attend to than replace something that already worked.

But when Logstash started giving us grief, we decided that the time had come
to replace it with Vector to power Morio's connector service.

So that's what this release is about: it replaces Logstash with Vector. We had
to rewrite our pipelines, change our UI code and schema to handle the
differences in configuration, but all in all it was easy to swap in Vector.

## So is it better?

Ever since switching to Vector, we've been unable to bring our production
instance to its knees. 
We measure throughput every 30 seconds, and we saw up to 45k events over
such a 30 seconds time period.

We average this out to 1.5k/s because that's easier to reason about,
but the effect is rather clear: it's much better now.
